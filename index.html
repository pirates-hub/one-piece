        <p>One Piece is a Japanese manga and anime series created by Eiichiro Oda. It has been serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump since July 1997 and follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy and his crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, as they search for the legendary treasure known as "One Piece".</p>

    <p>At some point during the Void Century, a man who was called 'Joy Boy' came across an island located at the end of the Grand Line. Here, he left behind a treasure of unimaginable value.[3] However, Dr. Vegapunk theorized that the person who would find it might not be the one Joy Boy initially was hoping for.[4] Stories of this treasure on the final island piqued the interest of Gol D. Roger, and he took the World Government forbidding exploration of the island as evidence of it being real.[5]

        Only the members of the Roger Pirates crew that journeyed to the island learned what exactly the treasure consists of. Upon arriving on the island and seeing Joy Boy's treasure, the Roger Pirates simply began to laugh. Roger described it as a "tale full of laughs", which gave him the idea to name the final island "Laugh Tale".[3] Sometime after the Roger Pirates' discovery, the world at large would begin to refer to Roger's treasures as the "One Piece".[2]
